<h3>Welcome to the tale of Sinichi</h3>
<article>
Sinichi is a student of the most dangerous martial art of them all <strong>Squarati</strong>. 
Studying under the master of the Squaresville Dojo. 
He is a man lost. A man without a past. 
Struggling with a present where he doesn't quite belong. 
Will our hero make it to the end of his training, 
will our hero discover his Past? 
Will Sinichi earn the coveted black-belt? 

Will he even survive?
