<h2>In the sensei's office</h2>
<div class="sensei-talk">Sinichi, you lack discipline to train. Your antics bring much shame on my Dojo! Why should I let you stay</div>
<div class="sinichi-talk">Sensei. Everyone knows who they are, but I have no past. I was not born but found. How can I focus when I am not whole. </div>
<div class="sensei-talk">Sinichi-san, I feel your plight. I grant you a quest, quest to find your chronicle.</div>
<button id="begin" onclick="alert( 'The End' )">Begin Quest</button>
